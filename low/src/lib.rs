//! This crate contains the low-level API of [reaper-rs](https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-rs).
//!
//! It is not recommended to use this API directly because it just exposes the
//! raw REAPER C++ functions, types and constants one to one in Rust. If you
//! want idiomatic Rust, type safety and convenience, please use the
//! [medium-level] or high-level API instead.
//!
//! At times it can still be useful to access the low-level API, mostly as
//! fallback if the function that you are looking for has not yet been lifted
//! to the medium-level API. To get started, best navigate to the [`Reaper`]
//! struct, which contains all exposed functions.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let reaper = rea_rs_low::Reaper::default();
//! use c_str_macro::c_str;
//! use std::ptr::null_mut;
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     reaper.ShowConsoleMsg(c_str!("Hello world from reaper-rs low-level API!").as_ptr());
//!     let track = reaper.GetTrack(null_mut(), 0);
//!     reaper.DeleteTrack(track);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! ## Goal
//!
//! The ultimate goal of the low-level API is to be on par with the REAPER C++
//! API, meaning that everything which is possible with the REAPER C++ API is
//! also possible with the *reaper-rs* low-level API. Improvements regarding
//! safety, convenience or style are not in its scope. It should serve as a
//! base for more idiomatic APIs built on top of it.
//!
//! ## Generated code
//!
//! Most parts of the low-level API are auto-generated from
//! `reaper_plugin_functions.h` using a combination of [bindgen](https://docs.rs/bindgen) and custom build script.
//!
//! ## C++ glue code
//!
//! There's some code which is not auto-generated, most notably the code to
//! "restore" functionality which "got lost in translation". The problem is
//! that some parts of the REAPER C++ API not just use C but also C++ features,
//! in particular virtual base classes. Rust can't call virtual functions or
//! implement them.
//!
//! The solution is to take a detour via C++ glue code:
//!
//! - Rust calling a C++ virtual function provided by REAPER:
//!     - Implement a method on the raw struct in Rust which calls a function
//!       written in C which in turn calls the C++ virtual function (Rust
//!       function → C function → C++ virtual function)
//!     - Example: `midi.rs` & `midi.cpp`
//!
//! - REAPER calling a C++ virtual function provided by Rust:
//!     - Implement the virtual base class in C++, let each function delegate
//!       to a corresponding free Rust function which in turn calls a method of
//!       a trait object (REAPER → C++ virtual function → Rust function)
//!     - Example: `control_surface.cpp` & `control_surface.rs`
//!
